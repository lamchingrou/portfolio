            I enjoy building scalable solutions that solve financial business problems. Some of the more interesting projects I have worked on in school include implementing WhatsApp banking for OCBC
            as part of my final year project, building a portfolio analyser for sponsor Goldman Sachs, and using microsrvice architecture to streamline payments in supermarkets (VMWare Award).<br/><br/>
            During most of these projects, my role was backend heavy and I am familiar with programming languages Python, TypeScript and Java, frameworks React, Flask and Spring Boot, as well as SQL and NoSQL cloud databases.<br/><br/>
            Another area I am interested in is Technology for Public Good. I am currently an intern in GovTech's National Digital Identity SGFinDex team, working mainly with TypeScript, Nodejs and AWS.<br/><br/>
            In my free time, I like going to the golf range, bringing my dog out for walks, üÄÑÔ∏è, watching shows, or spending time with family and friends. Feel free to connect with me on linkedin or drop me an email at crlam.2020@smu.edu.sg!
